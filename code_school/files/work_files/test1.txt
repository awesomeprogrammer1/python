Alex Jones was ordered to pay $965 million to the families of eight Sandy Hook victims and an F.B.I. agent
Alex Jones and Infowars’ parent company, Free Speech Systems, must pay close to $1 billion to the family members of eight victims of the shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary and an F.B.I. agent who responded to the scene of the 2012 massacre, which killed 20 first graders and six educators
***********************************************************************************************************************************************
Mr. Jones, who was not in court to hear the jury’s decision, had been found liable for defamation after he spent years falsely describing the shooting as a hoax and accusing the victims’ families of being actors complicit in the plot As a result, the families were threatened in person and online He used his Infowars platform to spread these lies

The jury’s decision divided the money among 15 plaintiffs 268 relatives of eight Sandy Hook victims and William Aldenberg an F.B.I. agent targeted by conspiracy theorists The plaintiffs were awarded varying amounts by the jurors, who considered their testimony and other evidence presented in court to gauge the damage done to their reputations, invasion of their privacy and other factors

This case presented the greatest financial risk to Mr. Jones, because he was found liable of violating Connecticut’s Unfair Trade Practices Act, by using lies about the shooting to sell products on Infowars There is no cap on punitive damages under that law

Mr. Jones’s assets are a matter of dispute. He has put (the) Infowars’ parent company into bankruptcy, but the families have accused him of doing so to avoid paying the damages
