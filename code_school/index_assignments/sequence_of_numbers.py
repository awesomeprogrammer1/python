"""
Write a program that prints part of the sequence 1 2 2 3 3 3 4 4 4 4 5 5 5 5 5..
(a number is repeated as many times as it is equal to).
A non-negative integer n is passed to the input of the program â€”
this is how many elements of the sequence the program should display.
The output is expected to be a sequence of numbers separated by a space in one line.

For example, if n = 7, then the program should output 1 2 2 3 3 3 4
