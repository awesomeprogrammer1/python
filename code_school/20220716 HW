# assignment 1: ask the user for two words of the same length.
# create a dictionary where the keys are the letters from the first word
# and the values are the letters of the second word
# assignment 2: ask the user to enter two sentences
# each sentence has the same number of words
# create a dictionary where the keys are the words from the first sentence
# and the values are the words from the second sentence
# hint: use the split method
# assignment 3: ask three users for their names
# and ask them for their emails and phone numbers {"Admin": {"email":"admin@gmail.com", "phone": "+1111111"}}
